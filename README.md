## Goals: 

1. Mitigate bio-matter from entering water ways.
1. Capture NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) readings & send to reporting dashboard.
1. Monitor Baffle Box contents & report when it needs to be emptied.
1. Empower biologists with additional data that may one day lead to accurate bloom prediction.

## Selling Points

+ Savings - Less manpower for labor intensive sampling
+ Keep people healthy - protect against disease clusters -- Alzheimer's - BMAA (NueroToxin) - & liver damage primarily.

## Data Collection & Reporting

Reporting Dashboard - Alerting

## Open Questions:

Location: <br>
+ Where to locate the baffle box's for maximum effectiveness?

Power - Solar: <br>
+ How much power do we need to operate the sensors?

Communication - LTE: <br>
+ Who's our service provider?
+ Who can we partner with to use their data?

Data Collection, Reporting & Storage:<br>
+ How often do we sample NPK readings?
+ How often do we sycn & report NPK readings?
+ How much local storage do we need?

Time to Failure: <br>
+ How often will sensors need to be replaced?
+ How much do new sensors cost?
  + Can we buy in bulk @ a discount?
+ 

1. What is a good phosphate limit for sensor to alert? <br>
