## Goals: 
1. Mitigate bio-matter from entering water ways.
1. Capture NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) readings & send to reporting dashboard.
1. Monitor Baffle Box contents & report when it needs to be emptied.
1. Empower biologists with additional data that may one day lead to accurate bloom prediction.

## Selling Points
+ Savings - Less manpower for labor intensive sampling
+ Keep people healthy - protect against disease clusters -- Alzheimer's - BMAA (NueroToxin) - & liver damage primarily.

## Proposed Sensors:
+ [HydroCycle-PO4 Phosphate Sensor](https://www.ott.com/products/water-quality-2/sea-bird-scientific-hydrocycle-po4-phosphate-sensor-1528/)

## Open Questions:
Location: <br>
+ Where to locate the baffle box's for maximum effectiveness?
  + A centralized location for neighborhood storm drains.

Power - Solar: <br>
+ How much power do we need to operate the sensors?
  + Input 	10.5 ... 18 VDC (HC-PO4)
  + Current draw	3.0 A max; 115 mA avg (HC-PO4)

Communication - LTE: <br>
+ Who's our service provider?
+ Who can we partner with to use their data?

Data Collection, Reporting & Storage:<br>
+ How often do we sample NPK readings?
  + Every 30 Minutes
+ How often do we sync & report NPK readings?
  + Immediately after samples are analysed.
+ How much local storage do we need?
  + 1 GB (HC-PO4)

Time to Failure: <br>
+ How often will sensors need to be replaced?
  + 5-month reagent life (HC-PO4)
+ How much do new sensors cost?
+ Can we buy in bulk @ a discount?
